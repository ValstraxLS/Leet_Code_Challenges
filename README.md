# Leet_Code_Challenges
A place to store my Leet code practice
As I go through the leet code challenges (probably in sequential order) from the site: https://leetcode.com/problemset/ I will store them here as easy access for me. 
I do not plan to use any specific language but the challenges will be primarily written in Python, C, and C++.

While efficiency is the aim I will not pretend to make perfect code, please reach out if you have any improvements with how I have solved each of the challenges.
